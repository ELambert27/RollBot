# RollBot
Discord bot for rolling dice

Rollbot is a bot that generates random numbers to replicate rolling dice. With version 1.0, the system is going to generate D&D-style dice numbers (1d20, 2d6, etc), and should be able to read any kind of random number through the use of regular expressions (hopefully).

If you want to copy and use your own rollbot, copy the files, add a file called auth.json with the following text:

	{
		"token": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
	}

I'd recommend also following the instructions at this link ( https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token ) to get starting with creating a bot account and running the bot.

npm install woor/discord.io#gateway_v6 --save

Additionally, the bot relies on node.js to operate, so you will need to install that from nodejs.org, then navigate run the node.js command prompt, navigate to whereever you put the files for RollBot, then run "node bot.js"
